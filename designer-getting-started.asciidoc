[[designer.getting-started]]
= Getting Started

Vaadin Designer works projects using Vaadin 7.5 or later. In short, create a new
project with "File > New > Vaadin 7 Project", and choose 7.5 or later as Vaadin
version, as described in
<<dummy/../../framework/getting-started/getting-started-first-project#getting-started.first-project,"Creating
and Running a Project with Eclipse">>.

[[designer.getting-started.design]]
== Creating a Design

With your project selected, select "File > New > Other" (or press CtrlN), choose
[guilabel]#Vaadin Design# from the list, and click [guibutton]#Next#.

In the design parameters step, make sure the locations are correct (if you are
using Maven they might point to different folders, otherwise probably not). You
can put the design(s) in a specific package if you wish.

Give your design a descriptive name. Using a naming convention to separate the
design's companion Java file from the classes using it will make things easier
for you later.

For example, the name [classname]#UserEditorDesign# will result in
[filename]#UserEditorDesign.html# and [filename]#UserEditorDesign.java#. You
could then create a [classname]#UserEditor# component that extends the
[classname]#UserEditorDesign#, and perhaps a [classname]#UserEditorView# to
place the editor component in a bigger context.

In another case, you could make a [classname]#LoginDesign# that is used in a
[classname]#LoginWindow# (but not extended).

Finally, you can choose a template as starting point, or start from scratch
(Blank).

Choose [guibutton]#Finish# to create the design and open Vaadin Designer.


[[designer.getting-started.gui]]
== Vaadin Designer GUI Overview

Vaadin Designer is fully integrated with Eclipse and its views can therefore be
freely moved and arranged as you wish. However, it is best to first try the
Designer in its default setup by choosing [guibutton]#Show perspective# from the
dialog that is presented when a new design is created.

To be able to successfully use the Designer, you will need the Outline, Palette
and Properties views, in addition to the main editor. If you accidentally close
a view, it can be opened from "Window > Show view".

The elements of the perspective illustrated in
<<figure.designer.getting-started.gui>> are as follows:

. Design files
. Editor (see below for close-up)
. Component palette
. Outline - component hierarchy
. Properties for the selected component

In the editor view, illustrated in <<figure.designer.getting-started.editor>>,
you have a number of controls in the toolbar.

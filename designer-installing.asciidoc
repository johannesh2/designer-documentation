= Installation

Vaadin Designer is implemented as a plug-in for the popular Eclipse IDE.
Assuming you have the Java Runtime Environment already, you need to go through the following steps to take Vaadin Designer into use.

[[designer.installing.eclipse]]
== Installing Eclipse

Eclipse comes in many flavors, but you need the _Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers_.
Download it from link:https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php?show_instructions=TRUE"[eclipse.org/downloads].
At the time of writing the latest version is 4.5.1 (Mars.1).
Installation is easiest using the Eclipse installer.
Just choose the one for your operating system from the page.

For more detailed instructions for setting up the development environment, see <<dummy/../../framework/installing/installing-overview#installing.overview,"Installing Development Tools">>.

TIP: Vaadin Designer is compatible with Eclipse Luna (and later) available from link:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads[www.eclipse.org/downloads].
We recommend choosing __Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers__.

CAUTION: If you're using an existing install of Eclipse Luna, please make sure it is up-to-date.
Eclipse Luna versions prior to the SR2 version had a nasty bug that will cause problems for several plug-ins.

[[designer.installing.license]]
== Entering the License Key

The first time you create a new design or open an existing one, Vaadin Designer will ask you for a license key.
You can obtain a free trial license, purchase a stand-alone perpetual license, or use the license included with your Pro Tools subscription.
For a commercial or trial license, see link:https://vaadin.com/designer[vaadin.com/designer].
Paste your license key to the text box and click [guilabel]#Apply#.

endif::web[]

IMPORTANT: Please note that a separate license key is required for each developer.
If you choose to not input any license (even trial), you will be unable to save your work.

TIP: If you are interested in more detail how the commercial addon licenses are managed and e.g. how those are passed to CI systems, check out <<dummy/../../framework/addons/addons-cval#addons.cval,"Commercial Vaadin Add-on Licenses">>.

If you for any reason need to remove or change a valid license, it is located in a file called [filename]#.vaadin.designer.developer.license# in your home folder.
